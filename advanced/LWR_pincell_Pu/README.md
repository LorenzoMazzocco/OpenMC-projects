# PLUTONIUM PRODUCTION IN LWR PINCELL

This is the first depletion simulation I performed. The goal of the project is to investigate the isotopic composition of 
plutonium produced in a PWR pincell at low burnup. In particular we want to know at which burnup (and the corresponding time of irradiation)
the plutonium crosses the weapon-grade composition threshold (7% Pu-240).

## Model
We use the previously [developed model](lib/Templates/EPR.py) for the EPR pincell.
