# Moderator to fuel ratio effect on k-inf 

The main goal of this project is to investigate the dependency of k-inf for an EPR assembly lattice on the ratio of moderator on fuel material in volume.\
\
The model is an EPR assebly infinite lattice with a parametrized fuel pellet outer radius. The cladding geometry is set up to follow the expansion of the fuel pellet.
The pitch is set and fixed at 1.26 cm. n different fuel pellet radiuses are tested and the corresponding k-inf is computed. The errorbars are not present in the [resulting 
plot](results.png) because the standard deviation of the k-inf distribution is negligible for all the configurations considered.
