# FULL CORE BREST-300

In this project we model the core of a BREST-type lead-cooled fast reactor. The main objective is to implement an algorithm that identifies the optimal isotopic composition of Pu in order to:

- Sustain a Breed and Burn cycle
- Keep the highest temperature in the core under a safety threshold to avoid melting of the fuel
- Keep the lowest temperature in the core under a safety threshold to avoid lead freezing
- Keep the ratio between inner core and outer core neutron flux in a range of values close enough to 1
