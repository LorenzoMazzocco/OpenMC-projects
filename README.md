# OpenMC-projects

The purpose of this repository is to host the code and the results of personal projects on neutronic simulations performed using the Monte Carlo code [OpenMC](https://openmc.org/).
<br></br>

The **structure** of the repository is the following:

|BASIC                                             |ADVANCED                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|[LWR pincell](./basic/LWR_pincell/)               |[EPR moderator-to-fuel ratio](./advanced/EPR_mod_fuel_ratio/)     |
|[SFR pincell](./basic/SFR_pincell/)               |[Lattice plotting tool](./advanced/EPR_lattice_table/)            |
|[EPR lattice](./basic/EPR_lattice/)               |[Plutonium production in LWR pincell](./advanced/LWR_pincell_Pu/) |
|[WGP breeding metric](./basic/WGP_breeding_metric/) |                                                                  |

<br></br>


The main distinction is between **basic** and **advanced** projects.\
Projects are classified as **ADVANCED** if one of the following conditions is met:
- the model is constructed using an ad hoc template class previously coded
- they include depletion calculations
- they include thermal-hydraulic coupling
