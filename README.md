# OpenMC-projects

The purpose of this repository is to host the code and the results of personal projects on neutronics simulation performed using the Monte Carlo code [OpenMC](https://openmc.org/).
<br></br>

The **structure** of the repository is the following:

|BASIC                               |ADVANCED                                                     |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|[LWR pincell](./basic/LWR_pincell/)|[EPR moderator-to-fuel ratio](./advanced/EPR_mod_fuel_ratio/)|
|[SFR pincell](./basic/SFR_pincell/)|                                                             |
|[EPR lattice](./basic/EPR_lattice/)|                                                             |

<br></br>


The main distinction is between **basic** and **advanced** projects.\
Projects are classified as **ADVANCED** if one of the following conditions is met:
- the model is constructed using an ad hoc template class previously coded
- they include depletion calculations
- they include thermal-hydraulic coupling
